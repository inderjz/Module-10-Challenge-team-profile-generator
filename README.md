  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  My project creates Team profiles for a work team. This project will help the employer to show other people his team and keep track of them.

  This project was developed by me to assist employers in keeping track of their teams and adding new members whenever a new employee joins the business.

  This program can be used by any business to remember the employee IDs, emails, and personal belongings.

  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

  First, please clone the git repo into your computer, and then you must downloads Node in order to utilize my project, and you can find instructions for doing so on the Full-Stack Blog. Additionally, you will need to install inquirer. To do so, enter the command 'npm i inquirer@8.2.4' in your terminal.

  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

  Run the command 'node index.js' in the terminal once the installation is complete. After answering to the questions, you should see a terminal record of your responses, a message that says "Check your HTML" will come back after all the responses are done. Then you can try to open your index.HTML file in the browser and you will see your results there.
